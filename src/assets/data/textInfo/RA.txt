The classrooms are well lit and ventilated with comfortable seating arrangements, making the place an ideal one for study. Professors who have been teaching for many years guide our students. Counselling SessionThey are not only teachers but are also friends, philosophers and guides and hence are easily approachable by any student. Doubts, if any, are clarified by the respective Professors. A student has to merely approach a Professor and ask the specific doubt. This one-to- one interaction goes a long way in the student gaining confidence on the subject and on the teacher to make him move ahead. Library Facility is a boon to our all students. Lots of good books from reputed publishers in Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry and Biology give plenty of problems and ideas to the ever- craving student if he needs those extra inputs.
