Indus believes that “Preparation for Life” is the purpose of education. Students need to be equipped with competencies such as innovation, critical thinking, life-long learning which will enable them to cope with a future which is increasingly volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous. Presently schools do not enable effective learning of these cognitive and emotional competencies within our classrooms.
Indus is one of the few schools that goes beyond academics, catering to students signature strengths.The Leadership Curriculum is unique to Indus. It allows students to set skill-based goals in several areas. We believe that skill development is essential to prepare students for life.
