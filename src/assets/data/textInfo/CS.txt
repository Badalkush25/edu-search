Chate Public School has a great reputation built up on many years of commitment and expertise. We have a high quality learning environment which we look after carefully. The ground provides super opportunities for creative play, outdoor learning, sport and community gatherings. The building is flexible, purposeful and provides a stimulating environment to maximize all opportunities whilst our facilities are very good, the real strength of the school lies within the people who work and play here. We pride ourselves as being a positive place where people young and old really matter.
