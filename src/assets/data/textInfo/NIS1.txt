Sasane Education Society has started an English Medium School since 17th June 1985 for the convenience of the students living in the vicinity of Hadapsar. For a long time, people from Hadapsar, Manjari, Vadki, were experiencing a difficulty in sending their children to far away schools to educate them through an English medium school. The Children had to face lot of hardships; while attending the school in Pune, because of the crowd and inconvenience in travelling. We are also proud to announce the commencement of our Arts, Commerce & Science Junior College from the academic year 2013-14. We have obtained  the necessary approval from the concerned authorities.
