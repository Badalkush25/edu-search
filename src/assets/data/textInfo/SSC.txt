SHREE CLASSES traces back its origin in a very small set up in 1990 and now when we looked back, this institute had crossed several milestones and will continue to cross newer and bigger milestones in its quest and thirst for quality and complete education. The name "SHREE PARIVAR" evokes all that is possible in giving quality oriented education to students, meeting parent needs strategically and successfully over the years. It typically signifies integrity, quality, performance, perfection, character and above all, values. We recognize the importance of nurturing relationships that reflect our culture of unwavering ethics and mutual respect.Shree Classes is always been student centric and value driven institute for last 32 years. A key factor that has helped Shree Classes to initiate, grow and establish ourselves as a leader on the educational front is the ultimate result of strong values we possess. We nurture values in our day to day thoughts and do not lose sight of these values under any circumstances. We try to inculcate and imbibe them in our students so that going forward they will be responsible citizen and proud alumni of Shree Classes.
