Muktangan believes in the philosophy that we should emphasize the best in Indian culture and heritage, adopt the best from the school educational system and evolve a pattern for all-round development of students. We help to develop their minds, physique and their personality and help them to develop into good responsible individuals.The school tries to inculcate in the students a spirit of love for all that is good, love for cleanliness, love for beauty and awareness of the aesthetic sense.The school has a highly educated, well trained and competent staff. The first batch of students appeared for S.S.C. examination in March 1984 and our results were 100%. More than half the number of students secured above 75%. Since then the school has maintained a glorious tradition of excellent results.
