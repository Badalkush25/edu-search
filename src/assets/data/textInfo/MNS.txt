"Millennium National School will strengthen its capacity as a healthy place in which to live, learn and work. It will make student learning visible to both teachers and students themselves so that teachers can know their impact and students learn to become their own teachers. It will integrate the practice of teaching for sustainability as a cross curricular theme.
The idea is to have the learner perform at a level that is beyond his/her expectations while ensuring that the motivation for learning will come from the inside."
