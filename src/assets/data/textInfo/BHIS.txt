"Asia’s most trusted education brand is now coming to the hub of education ‘Pune’. Billabong High International school (BHIS) launches Pune’s first company owned company operated school in Hadapsar. We will start admissions for next academic year (2019 – 2020) in September 2018. This is our next gen school where we have redefined learning spaces in the form of learning commons (we believe that each child learns differently, Hence we have created a common classroom where children can either study by themselves or in groups using different modes of information). The school has an innovation room, a unique range of Sports and Performing Arts activities to choose from and is technologically advanced school.
BHIS Pune is a proposed CBSE and IGCSE school currently starting from preschool to Grade 5. BHIS is setup in a 2 acre lush green plot. The school is centrally located in a residential area and a prominent mall. At BHIS Pune, students will practically learn to apply what they understand through various modes in their student program.
We will be taking utmost care of our children, hence BHIS, Pune is being built by the best Design Consultants to make sure all safety and security norms are adhered to."
