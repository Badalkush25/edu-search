"The Institute believes that education does not only mean making a person literate but also enhancing the positive traits in one’s personality to an optimum level. It believes that a school creates a profound and long-lasting impact on one’s existence. Blue Ridge Public School is the first school to be run under the aegis of Blue Ridge Educational Institute. In the years to come BREI intends to venture further and establish more institutions offering education at varied levels.
Vision
BREI’s Blue Ridge Public School seeks to provide the best place for a child to learn, to grow and to evolve into a balanced and strong individual. The School intends to strive to become a second home for your child. The School located in the Blue Ridge Township will be open for not just the Township but also for students from in and around Hinjawadi."
