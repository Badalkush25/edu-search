"Innovative International Schools work with the aspiration and commitment to provide an enjoyable and enriching educational experience to children - one that inspires and facilitates them to realise their full potential. The Schools emphasise academic excellence and all-round development of children by offering a fine blend of curricular and co-curricular activities.
At Innovative International School, we believe that every child is uniquely talented and given a congenial environment, each will blossom beyond imagination. Our constant endeavour is to harness and channel the energies and capabilities inherent in each child through active participation and creative involvement in the classroom and wholehearted engagement in various activities.
The ever-evolving and progressive curricula adopted by the Schools, supported by contemporary pedagogical practices go a long way in widening the intellectual and creative capacity of children. Through their comprehensive yet flexible curriculum framework, the Schools hope to make a difference in the lives of children by enabling them to be happy and successful, and prepare them to be responsible citizens."
