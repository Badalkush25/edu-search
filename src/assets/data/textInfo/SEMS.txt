"The Pune Sevasadan Society was started in the year 1909 by Late Smt. Ramabai Ranade (wife of Late Hon’ble Justice M. G. Ranade) with the help of social reformist Late Shri. G. K. Deodhor. The Society has been a pioneer Institution with a mission to serve the nation in the field of all round development and upliftment of the status of women. The Society’s work is so well known and held in such high esteem that the Government of Maharashtra had put at its disposal a plot of land admeasuring 3.5 acres at Patwardhan Baug, Erandwane, Pune, to enable it to expand its activities.
The Society thereaffer constructed a well-designed school building on this beautiful plot and an English Medium School for girls started functioning in the year 1997 with pre-primary classes and Std-I. However, due to pressing need of the hour and persistent demand from our parents and well-wishers, the broad-minded Society opened its admissions for boys too from the following academic year 1998-99. The School today, has classes running from Mini K. G. to Std-X."
