"At The HDFC School we believe in recruiting empowered teachers, who are reflective decision makers, who find joy in learning and in investigating the teaching-learning process - ones who view learning as construction and teaching as a facilitating process to enhance and enrich development.

The role of teachers at The HDFC School and the individual rationale for becoming a teacher must encompass all three of the tenets below:
Deep love for children
Passionate interest in a certain field of knowledge
Positive and warm attitude"
