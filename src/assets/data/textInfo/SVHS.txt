"St.Vincent’s High School, Camp, Pune was established in 1867. From the confines of a rented bungalow 150 years ago, to the magnificent edifice that stands tall today, watching over the huge expanse of the playground and the campus, St. Vincent’s has grown from strength to strength.
The school boasts of world-class infrastructure including a 4-and-a-half acre playground with the stadium, 4 auditoriums that seat over 1500, two libraries that boast a collection of over 30000 books, 50 IT-enabled learning rooms, a swimming pool, and an enviable sports heritage.
From humble and modest beginnings, starting with 5 students to over 2700 students today from every stratum of society, regardless of religion or financial status, St. Vincent’s is a much sought-after school in Pune, well-known for academics, sports, and all-around character development in equal measure."
