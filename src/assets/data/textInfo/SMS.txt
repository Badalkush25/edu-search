Established in 1866, St. Mary’s School, Pune is proud of its long history and academic tradition. At the same time, it is unique in the way it has kept abreast with the new trends in education and has responded to the changing needs of children. St. Mary’s has several major strengths: a solid academic programme, a child centered approach and an unbeatable ambience. Christian principles form its foundation and it is registered as a minority school. However admissions are open to children of all communities.
St. Mary’s School is a day school located in serene, verdant surroundings spread over an impressive campus in the Cantonment area of Pune. Under its banner, it has separate sections for Girls, Boys and a Co-ed Junior College.Indeed, it is wonderful how the Lord has led us through these past years. As the School turns 150, I realize how the Lord has blessed the School in Innumerable ways! I pray that the Lord gives me the strength and enthusiasm to be a steward of this great institution to continue the work begun 150 years ago by courageous and dedicated servants.
