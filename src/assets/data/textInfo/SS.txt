Born out of Krishnamurtiâ€™s oft-expressed wish to his friend, the late Shri Achyut Patwardhan whose tireless efforts and generous assistance from several well-wishers, the Sahyadri School commenced in 1995. Located on Tiwai Hill and nestled in the valley of the Bhima River, the school is surrounded by gently sloping green forest hills and valleys, 770m above sea level. Here, the children learn amidst nature from books and trees and birds; they work with their hands and their abundant imagination. From academics to art, theatre, multiple sports and other activities, they explore their potential, as they do the nature around them
