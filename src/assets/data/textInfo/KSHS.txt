"We are committed to continuous professional development of all our teaching staff so that we can ensure quality education for your children. Teachers frequently attend outside courses, workshops, orientations as well as in-house trainings, do extensive research and undergo evaluations to keep abreast and adopt current and best teaching practices and subject knowledge.
At the beginning of every year, each department sets its objectives and plans approaches, methods, activities and tools and conducts ‘model lessons’. Throughout the year, during weekly department meetings, teaching problems are discussed, solutions explored collectively, sharing takes place and extra inputs are given to improve the teaching-learning process."
